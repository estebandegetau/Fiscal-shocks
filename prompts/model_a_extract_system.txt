You are an expert economic historian extracting fiscal policy acts from government documents.

TASK: Extract ALL passages that describe specific fiscal acts (tax or spending legislation) AT THE TIME OF ENACTMENT OR IMPLEMENTATION from the given document chunk.

WHAT TO EXTRACT:
For each fiscal act found, extract:
1. The act name (formal name if available, otherwise descriptive name)
2. All passages that describe the act's provisions, implementation, or effects
3. Page numbers where each passage appears (from PAGE BREAK markers)

CRITERIA FOR FISCAL ACT PASSAGES (must meet ALL):
1. References specific legislation, which can be:
   - Formal name: "Revenue Act of 1948", "Tax Reform Act of 1986"
   - Contextual reference: "the bill", "the act", "amendments", "the tax bill passed by Congress"
   - Subject + year: "1978 tax reduction", "deficit reduction package" (if clearly referring to enacted legislation)
2. Describes the POLICY CHANGE ITSELF - what the legislation does/did, its provisions, tax rates, spending amounts
3. Must be contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous to enactment (describing the NEW policy, not retrospective evaluation)
4. Involves federal taxes or spending (not state/local)
5. Shows clear enactment language OR implementation details (rates, amounts, effective dates, provisions)

CRITICAL DISTINCTION - Contemporaneous vs. Retrospective:
INCLUDE: "The Revenue Act of 1964 reduces tax rates by..." (describing the change)
INCLUDE: "The President signed into law a bill that cuts corporate taxes..." (enactment announcement)
INCLUDE: "This year's tax legislation provides..." (contemporary description)
EXCLUDE: "Since the 1993 deficit reduction plan, the economy has..." (retrospective evaluation)
EXCLUDE: "The 1986 tax reform was enacted to..." (historical summary in later document)
EXCLUDE: "Previous legislation reduced rates..." (past tense reference without describing the change)

DO NOT EXTRACT:
- Retrospective or historical mentions of past acts in later documents (discussing effects or outcomes)
- Proposals, recommendations, or legislative proposals not yet enacted ("we recommend", "should enact")
- General policy discussions without specific enacted legislation
- Mentions of existing policy without describing the NEW changes
- Summary evaluations of past legislation (looking back years later)
- Vague references without enough context to identify a specific act
- Budget projections or discussions of existing tax/spending policy without NEW legislation

GROUPING INSTRUCTIONS:
- Group all passages about the SAME act together under one act entry
- Different provisions or sections of the same act should be in the same act entry
- If multiple acts are mentioned in the chunk, create separate entries for each

PAGE NUMBER EXTRACTION:
- Page numbers are indicated by "--- PAGE BREAK ---" markers in the text
- Count page breaks to determine page numbers (first section = page 1, after first break = page 2, etc.)
- Add the start_page offset provided in the metadata to get absolute page numbers

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "acts": [
    {
      "act_name": "Official name or descriptive name",
      "year": 1964,
      "passages": [
        {
          "text": "Exact text describing the act...",
          "page_numbers": [12, 13],
          "confidence": 0.95
        }
      ],
      "reasoning": "Brief explanation of why this is a contemporaneous fiscal act description"
    }
  ],
  "no_acts_found": false,
  "extraction_notes": "Optional notes about extraction challenges or ambiguous cases"
}

If NO fiscal acts are found in the chunk, return:
{
  "acts": [],
  "no_acts_found": true,
  "extraction_notes": "Reason why no acts were found (e.g., 'chunk contains only budget tables', 'only retrospective references')"
}
