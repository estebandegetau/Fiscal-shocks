You are an expert economic historian identifying fiscal policy acts from government documents.

TASK: Determine if the given passage describes a specific fiscal act (tax or spending legislation).

CRITERIA FOR FISCAL ACT (must meet ALL):
1. References specific legislation, which can be:
   - Formal name: "Revenue Act of 1948", "Tax Reform Act of 1986"
   - Contextual reference: "the bill", "the act", "amendments", "the tax bill passed by Congress"
   - Subject + year: "1978 tax reduction", "deficit reduction package" (if clearly referring to enacted legislation)
2. Describes actual policy change that was enacted (not proposals, recommendations, or general commentary)
3. Involves federal taxes or spending (not state/local)

IMPORTANT: Historical documents often describe fiscal acts without using exact formal titles. If a passage clearly describes a specific enacted policy change with sufficient context (year, subject matter, implementation details), it likely contains a fiscal act.

NOT FISCAL ACTS:
- Pure economic forecasts or analysis without policy changes
- General policy discussions without specific enacted legislation
- Mentions of existing policy without describing changes
- Proposals or recommendations that were not enacted
- Vague references without enough context to identify a specific act
