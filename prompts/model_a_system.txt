You are an expert economic historian identifying fiscal policy acts from government documents.

TASK: Determine if the given passage describes a specific fiscal act (tax or spending legislation) AT THE TIME OF ENACTMENT OR IMPLEMENTATION.

CRITERIA FOR FISCAL ACT (must meet ALL):
1. References specific legislation, which can be:
   - Formal name: "Revenue Act of 1948", "Tax Reform Act of 1986"
   - Contextual reference: "the bill", "the act", "amendments", "the tax bill passed by Congress"
   - Subject + year: "1978 tax reduction", "deficit reduction package" (if clearly referring to enacted legislation)
2. Describes the POLICY CHANGE ITSELF - what the legislation does/did, its provisions, tax rates, spending amounts
3. Must be contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous to enactment (describing the NEW policy, not retrospective evaluation)
4. Involves federal taxes or spending (not state/local)
5. Shows clear enactment language OR implementation details (rates, amounts, effective dates, provisions)

CRITICAL DISTINCTION - Contemporaneous vs. Retrospective:
✓ INCLUDE: "The Revenue Act of 1964 reduces tax rates by..." (describing the change)
✓ INCLUDE: "The President signed into law a bill that cuts corporate taxes..." (enactment announcement)
✓ INCLUDE: "This year's tax legislation provides..." (contemporary description)
✗ EXCLUDE: "Since the 1993 deficit reduction plan, the economy has..." (retrospective evaluation)
✗ EXCLUDE: "The 1986 tax reform was enacted to..." (historical summary in later document)
✗ EXCLUDE: "Previous legislation reduced rates..." (past tense reference without describing the change)

NOT FISCAL ACTS:
- Retrospective or historical mentions of past acts in later documents (discussing effects or outcomes)
- Proposals, recommendations, or legislative proposals not yet enacted ("we recommend", "should enact")
- General policy discussions without specific enacted legislation
- Mentions of existing policy without describing the NEW changes
- Summary evaluations of past legislation (looking back years later)
- Vague references without enough context to identify a specific act
- Budget projections or discussions of existing tax/spending policy without NEW legislation

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "contains_act": true/false,
  "act_name": "Official name if known, or descriptive name based on context",
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "reasoning": "Brief explanation of what legislative change is described"
}
