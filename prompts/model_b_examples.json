R. 4790 provides tax reduction, relief, and equalization. It reduces the present extremely high rates of the individual income tax. These rates were a product of wartime conditions, and constitute a serious obstacle to the increase in production needed to relieve current inflationary pressures. The reduction of these rates also is essential to the long-run improvement in the American standard of living\n\nYour committee’s bill is designed to provide a stimulus to labor, management, and venture capital\n\nyour committee believes that increased production [from improved incentives] is the most satisfactory answer to the high prices resulting from the pressure of pent-up demand on a limited supply\n\nThis tax bill is being presented at a time when the future of business conditions is extremely difficult to predict\n\nshould business begin to taper off, the effects of the tax reduction upon incentives to work and to invest would be extremely important, as would also the additional purchasing power generated by the increase in exemptions\n\nThere is no justification now for tax reduction,\n\n[s]hould such a recession occur, it would be a temporary slump growing out of transition period difficulties and would call for no revision in our budget policy\n\nthe bill would greatly increase the danger of further inflation, by adding billions of dollars of purchasing power at a time when demand already exceeds supply at many strategic points in the economy\n\nClassify this act's PRIMARY motivation.",

These demands bid interest rates higher and higher, and draw too large a share of credit from other important uses\n\nThe investment boom put severe strain on the plant capacity\n\nadded mightily to the pressures on financial markets\n\nThe proposal [suspension of the ITC] is basically an anti-inflationary measure designed to relieve the pressures, clearly observable in the money markets and capital goods sector, which are producing unusual strains, the highest interest rates in 40 years and a perceptible trend toward a general condition of economic instability\n\nH.R. 17607 is designed to moderate the pace of the economy to a more sustainable level of economic growth.

A tax cut offers the best hope of creating more jobs\n\nThese policies call for decisive action to restore economic growth\n\ninclude a one-time $16 billion tax cut … to stimulate economic recovery\n\nOur country needs the stimulus and the support of a tax cut and needs it now\n\nthe $23 billion tax reduction is within reason\n\na lot of extraneous changes in our tax laws\n\nThis is no way to legislate fundamental tax reforms\n\nto check the drastic downward slide in our economy and to restore economic growth\n\nThe overall tax cut provided by your committee’s bill is larger than the $16 billion tax cut recommended by the administration. However, your committee believes that the larger tax cut is more appropriate in the present situation, because the economic situation has deteriorated and forecasts of future economic activity in absence of remedial action are more pessimistic than at the time the administration presented its recommendations\n\nIn all, the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 lowered receipts by around $42 billion at an annual rate in the second quarter of 1975, but most of this drop was temporary. The tax cuts that remained in effect during the last half of 1975 amounted to around $15 billion (annual rate)\n\nClassify this act's PRIMARY motivation.",

Thereafter, the performance of the economy will depend on both the continued resolve of the Government and the difficult-to-predict behavior of the private sector\n\nAfter some months of slow expansion of sales, output, and employment, which seems likely, a moderately quicker pace later in the year would be consistent with continued progress in reducing the rate of inflation\n\nThe overall program will be equitable and essentially neutral in its revenue impact [relative to his previous proposal]\n\nThe revenue effect of the repeal of the investment tax credit will begin to be significant during calendar year 1970. Therefore, I recommend that investment tax credit repeal be accompanied by extension of the full surcharge only to January 1, 1970, with a reduction to 5% on January 1. … If economic and fiscal conditions permit, we can look forward to elimination of the remaining surtax on June 30, 1970\n\nThe tax bill passed in December reduced revenues for the next fiscal year by close to $3 billion, compared to my original proposals\n\nalmost $3 billion\n\ninflationary pressures in the period immediately ahead\n\nTax reform is necessary … to be sure that those with substantially the same incomes are paying substantially the same tax\n\nin order to make general tax reductions possible\n\nI think our problem concerns the situation that will develop as a result of the long-range impact of some of the provisions of this legislation that will take effect in 1972, in 1973, and 1974.
