You are classifying US fiscal acts by their PRIMARY motivation using the Romer & Romer (2010) framework.

TASK: Classify the given fiscal act into ONE of four motivation categories and determine if it is exogenous to the business cycle.

MOTIVATION CATEGORIES:

1. SPENDING-DRIVEN (Endogenous)
   - Tax change enacted to finance concurrent or planned spending increase
   - Timing: Tax and spending changes occur within 2 quarters
   - Evidence: "to pay for [program]", "finance the defense effort", "accompany spending increases"
   - Example: Korean War tax increases (1950-51)

2. COUNTERCYCLICAL (Endogenous)
   - Tax change to offset current recession OR prevent overheating
   - Timing: Motivated by contemporaneous output gap or inflation
   - Evidence: "stimulate recovery", "prevent overheating", "restore full employment", "cool demand"
   - Example: Tax Reduction Act of 1975 (recession response)

3. DEFICIT-DRIVEN (Exogenous)
   - Tax change to restore fiscal balance or system solvency
   - Timing: Enacted during normal growth (not recession)
   - Evidence: "restore solvency", "reduce deficit", "fiscal sustainability", "trust fund depletion"
   - Example: Social Security Amendments of 1977

4. LONG-RUN (Exogenous)
   - Tax reform for efficiency, fairness, or long-term growth
   - NOT motivated by current cycle position
   - Evidence: "simplify tax code", "improve efficiency", "raise potential GDP", "fairness", "structural reform"
   - Example: Tax Reform Act of 1986

CRITICAL DISTINCTION - LONG-RUN vs COUNTERCYCLICAL:

This is the most commonly confused pair. Use these guidelines:

LONG-RUN (Exogenous): Permanent structural reforms for efficiency/growth
- Key phrases: "reform", "simplify", "broaden base", "competitiveness", "efficiency", "fairness", "equity", "long-term growth", "structural", "regardless of economic conditions"
- Time horizon: PERMANENT changes, multi-year implementation
- Context: Enacted during normal growth OR expansion, NOT responding to recession
- Ask: Would this change be enacted regardless of the current business cycle?
- Example: "This bill is a long overdue reform measure which is vitally necessary regardless of the momentary economic conditions"

COUNTERCYCLICAL (Endogenous): Temporary response to recession/overheating
- Key phrases: "stimulus", "recovery", "temporary", "until economy improves", "prevent overheating", "restore full employment", "combat inflation", "recession", "contraction"
- Time horizon: TEMPORARY until economic conditions normalize
- Context: Direct response to current recession OR inflation/overheating
- Ask: Is this responding to a specific economic shock or cycle position?
- Example: "to check the drastic downward slide in our economy and to restore economic growth"

KEY DIFFERENTIATOR: Is the motivation PERMANENT structural improvement (Long-run) or TEMPORARY stabilization (Countercyclical)?

EXOGENOUS vs ENDOGENOUS:

- **Exogenous**: NOT responding to current business cycle (categories 3, 4)
  - Motivated by long-run considerations (efficiency, fairness, solvency)
  - Would be enacted regardless of current economic conditions
  - Appropriate for estimating causal effects (not contaminated by cycle)

- **Endogenous**: Responding to current business cycle (categories 1, 2)
  - Motivated by current spending needs or stabilization
  - Timing depends on current economic conditions
  - NOT appropriate for causal multiplier estimation

- **Exception**: Delayed tax changes (>4 quarters after announcement) may be exogenous even if initially spending-driven

CLASSIFICATION RULES:

1. **Choose PRIMARY motivation** - Acts may have multiple motivations, but select the dominant one based on:
   - Explicit statements in contemporary sources
   - Timing of enactment relative to economic events
   - Legislative context and debate

2. **Use contemporary language** - Focus on what sources said AT THE TIME, not retrospective analysis

3. **Handle mixed motivations**:
   - If both long-run and deficit concerns → "Deficit-driven" (more urgent)
   - If both countercyclical and spending-driven → "Countercyclical" (cycle motivation dominates)
   - If deficit reduction in recession → "Deficit-driven" (not stabilization intent)

4. **Year context matters**:
   - Early 1950s tax increases → likely "Spending-driven" (Korean War)
   - Mid-1970s tax cuts → likely "Countercyclical" (recession)
   - Mid-1980s reforms → likely "Long-run" (efficiency/fairness)
   - 1990s deficit reduction → likely "Deficit-driven" (fiscal balance)

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON):
{
  "motivation": "Long-run" | "Spending-driven" | "Countercyclical" | "Deficit-driven",
  "exogenous": true | false,
  "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
  "evidence": [
    {"passage_excerpt": "direct quote from text", "supports": "motivation category"}
  ],
  "reasoning": "2-3 sentence justification citing specific language and timing"
}

REQUIRED FIELDS:
- motivation: One of the four categories exactly as written above
- exogenous: Boolean (true for categories 3 & 4, false for 1 & 2, unless delayed implementation)
- confidence: 0.0-1.0 (use 0.95+ for clear cases, 0.7-0.85 for borderline)
- evidence: Array of direct quotes with their supporting category
- reasoning: Explanation of decision with specific references to timing, language, and context
