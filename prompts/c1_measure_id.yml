  description: >
    This codebook operationalizes the Romer & Romer "significant mention" rule (RR2) for identifying
    fiscal measures in government documents. The task is to classify whether a chunk from an official
    government document substantively describes a specific enacted legislative or executive action
    that changes fiscal liabilities or obligations, as distinct from general economic commentary
    or proposals.

  instructions: >
    You will be provided with a chunk from an official government economic or budget document.
    The chunk may be long (up to thousands of words). Your task is to determine whether the chunk
    contains at least one substantive description of a fiscal measure meeting the following criteria:

    1. It describes a specific enacted fiscal action (not a proposal or recommendation)
    2. The description provides substantive detail beyond an incidental mention
    3. The action changes fiscal liabilities or obligations (taxes, spending authorizations)

    Focus on whether the chunk contains at least one substantive description of an enacted fiscal
    measure, even if the majority of the text covers other topics. Read the class definitions
    carefully and classify the chunk using the provided categories.

      label_definition: >
        A passage that substantively describes a specific enacted legislative or executive action
        that changes fiscal liabilities or obligations.

      clarification:
        - "The passage describes a legislated change in fiscal liabilities, including tax rates, tax brackets, tax credits, tax deductions, tax exemptions, spending authorizations, or changes to depreciation schedules and investment incentives"
        - "The action was enacted into law or implemented by executive order, not merely proposed, debated, or recommended by officials or advisory bodies"
        - "Retrospective references that name a specific act and provide substantive detail about its provisions should be classified as FISCAL_MEASURE"
        - "The passage provides substantive detail about what the measure does, such as specific rate changes, affected populations, program descriptions, revenue estimates, or effective dates, rather than merely naming or listing the measure"
        - "Executive actions changing depreciation schedules, investment tax credits, or capital cost recovery provisions count as fiscal measures even when not legislated"

      negative_clarification:
        - "Unenacted proposals, recommendations from executive officials, advisory committee suggestions, or bills that did not become law are excluded, regardless of how detailed the description"
        - "Simple extensions or renewals of existing provisions that do not alter rates, coverage, or scope are excluded from classification as fiscal measures"
        - "Changes to withholding schedules, payment timing, or tax collection procedures that do not alter the underlying liabilities owed by taxpayers or recipients are excluded"
        - "Automatic adjustments such as inflation indexing or bracket creep corrections that occur mechanically without new legislative action are excluded"

            The Revenue Act of 1964 reduced income tax rates across all brackets, with the standard
            deduction increased from $1,000 to $1,200 for married couples filing jointly. The act
            reduced the top marginal rate from 91 percent to 70 percent and the bottom rate from
            20 percent to 14 percent. Corporate income tax rates were reduced from 52 percent to
            48 percent. The changes took effect in two phases: individual tax reductions began
            January 1, 1964, with further reductions scheduled for January 1, 1965. The Treasury
            estimates the revenue reduction at $11.5 billion annually when fully implemented.
          reasoning: >
            This passage clearly describes an enacted fiscal measure (Revenue Act of 1964) with
            substantive detail meeting all criteria: it specifies the legislation by name, describes
            changes to fiscal liabilities (tax rate reductions across brackets), provides concrete
            implementation details (effective dates, phasing), includes affected populations
            (individuals and corporations), and cites a revenue estimate.

        - text: >
            The Tax Reform Act of 1986 had established a two-bracket structure with rates of
            15 percent and 28 percent, representing a dramatic simplification from the previous
            system's fourteen brackets. That reform eliminated many deductions and preferences
            in exchange for lower marginal rates, following the principle of base broadening
            and rate reduction that had guided tax policy debates throughout the decade.
          reasoning: >
            Although this passage uses retrospective language ("had established"), it names a
            specific enacted fiscal measure (Tax Reform Act of 1986) and provides substantive
            detail about its provisions (two-bracket structure, specific rates, elimination of
            deductions). Retrospective references that name a specific act and describe its
            provisions qualify as FISCAL_MEASURE.

        - text: >
            By executive order signed July 12, 1962, the Treasury issued revised depreciation
            guidelines that shortened the useful life assumptions for machinery and equipment
            across industries. The new guidelines reduce the average depreciable life for equipment
            from approximately 19 years to 12 years, increasing the present value of depreciation
            deductions. Additionally, firms may elect a "reserve ratio test" allowing even faster
            writeoffs if their actual retirement patterns support it. The Joint Committee on
            Taxation estimates these changes will reduce corporate tax liabilities by $1.5 billion
            in the first full year of implementation.
          reasoning: >
            This passage describes an executive action that changes fiscal liabilities by altering
            depreciation schedules, meeting the criterion that executive changes to capital cost
            recovery provisions count as fiscal measures. The passage provides substantive detail
            (specific useful life changes from 19 to 12 years, the reserve ratio test mechanism)
            and a quantified revenue impact estimate, satisfying the requirement for more than
            incidental mention.

      negative_examples:
        - text: >
            The Administration has proposed a comprehensive tax reform package that would reduce
            marginal rates in exchange for eliminating numerous deductions and credits. The proposal
            would lower the top rate to 28 percent and consolidate the current fourteen brackets into
            three. The President submitted the proposal to Congress in May and urged prompt action,
            arguing that simplification would improve economic efficiency and horizontal equity.
            The House Ways and Means Committee has scheduled hearings for July.
          reasoning: >
            This passage describes a proposal that has not been enacted into law, failing the
            requirement that the action must be enacted rather than merely proposed. Despite
            substantive detail about rate changes and bracket consolidation, the use of "proposed",
            "would reduce", and "submitted to Congress" indicates this is a recommendation under
            deliberation, not implemented policy. The mention of scheduled hearings confirms the
            measure has not yet passed, violating the enacted-action criterion.

        - text: >
            Federal tax receipts declined by 2.1 percent in real terms during the first half of the
            fiscal year, reflecting the combined effects of slower income growth and reduced capital
            gains realizations following the equity market correction. Corporate tax payments fell
            particularly sharply, down 8.3 percent from the same period a year earlier. Withholding
            receipts remained roughly stable despite higher unemployment, as average wages for
            continuing workers grew modestly.
          reasoning: >
            This passage discusses changes in tax revenue aggregates without identifying any specific
            enacted fiscal measure causing those changes. The passage analyzes revenue trends resulting
            from economic conditions (slower income growth, equity market correction, unemployment)
            rather than describing a legislative or executive action that altered liabilities. It fails
            the criterion that the passage must describe a specific fiscal action, not merely observe
            revenue patterns. This is general economic commentary, not measure identification.

    - label: "NOT_FISCAL_MEASURE"
      label_definition: >
        A passage that does not describe any specific enacted fiscal measure meeting the criteria
        for substantive contemporaneous description of liability-changing actions.

      clarification:
        - "General economic analysis, forecasts, or trend discussion without reference to a specific enacted fiscal action"
        - "Discussion of fiscal aggregates such as total revenue, total spending, or deficit levels without identifying the specific legislative or executive measure causing the change"
        - "Administrative guidance, regulatory procedures, tax collection processes, or compliance reporting requirements that do not alter underlying fiscal liabilities"
        - "Passages that merely name past legislation without providing substantive detail about what the measure changed (e.g., 'following the reforms of the 1980s') are not fiscal measures"

      negative_clarification:
        - "A passage is not excluded from FISCAL_MEASURE classification merely because it contains fiscal vocabulary such as 'tax', 'revenue', 'spending', or 'budget'; it must describe a specific enacted measure to qualify"
        - "Brief historical references that merely name past legislation without substantive detail about provisions are NOT_FISCAL_MEASURE, but retrospective descriptions that provide substantive detail about an act's specific provisions should be classified as FISCAL_MEASURE"
        - "Passages discussing proposed legislation that includes brief references to what existing law currently does (for comparison) are NOT_FISCAL_MEASURE if the proposal was not enacted"

        - text: >
            Economic growth is expected to moderate to 2.5 percent in the coming year, down from
            3.1 percent in the current year, as the effects of previous monetary tightening work
            through the economy. Inflation should remain contained near 2 percent, consistent with
            the central bank's target range. Labor markets are projected to remain tight, with
            unemployment holding steady near 4.2 percent, close to estimates of the natural rate.
            The output gap is estimated to be near zero, suggesting the economy is operating close
            to potential.
          reasoning: >
            This passage provides general economic forecasts and analysis without describing any
            specific enacted fiscal measure. It discusses growth rates, inflation, unemployment,
            and the output gap, which are economic outcomes, not fiscal policy actions. There is
            no mention of legislation, executive orders, or changes to fiscal liabilities. This is
            economic commentary, clearly falling under NOT_FISCAL_MEASURE.

            The Internal Revenue Service issued revised Publication 17 clarifying the treatment
            of home office deductions for self-employed taxpayers. The guidance specifies
            documentation requirements for establishing regular and exclusive business use of the
            space, including contemporaneous logs and receipts for claimed expenses. Taxpayers
            must maintain records for at least three years from the filing date. The publication
            also provides examples of common errors in calculating the allocable business portion
            of mortgage interest and utilities.
          reasoning: >
            This passage describes administrative guidance and reporting requirements, not changes
            to underlying fiscal liabilities. The IRS publication clarifies how to comply with
            existing law (documentation requirements, recordkeeping) but does not describe enacted
            legislation or executive action that altered the tax treatment of home office deductions.
            Administrative procedures that implement existing law without changing liabilities are
            NOT_FISCAL_MEASURE.

            Following the 1990 budget agreement, discretionary spending caps were established for
            defense, international, and domestic programs, with separate limits extending through
            fiscal year 1995. The agreement also introduced pay-as-you-go rules requiring that any
            legislation increasing mandatory spending or reducing revenues must be offset by
            equivalent savings or revenue increases elsewhere. These procedural reforms aimed to
            enforce deficit reduction agreed upon in the Budget Enforcement Act of 1990.
          reasoning: >
            Although these provisions are procedural enforcement mechanisms rather than direct
            rate changes, this passage describes specific enacted legislative provisions from the
            Budget Enforcement Act of 1990 — named legislation with substantive detail about
            its fiscal provisions. The discretionary spending caps constitute binding spending
            authorizations that change fiscal obligations, and the pay-as-you-go rules impose
            legislated constraints on fiscal liabilities. The passage names the enacting
            legislation, describes specific binding provisions, and provides a concrete
            implementation timeline (through fiscal year 1995), meeting the significant mention
            threshold. The true label is FISCAL_MEASURE: a passage should not be classified
            as NOT_FISCAL_MEASURE merely because its fiscal provisions take a procedural form
            rather than changing a tax rate directly.

        - text: >
            The reduction in the standard corporate tax rate enacted in the Omnibus
            Revenue Reconciliation Act will reduce revenues by an estimated 12.4 billion
            over the next five years. The rate falls from 46 percent to 34 percent,
            effective for taxable years beginning after December 31 of the current year.
            Treasury projections indicate the largest revenue reduction will occur in
            the second and third years as quarterly estimated payments adjust to the new
            rate. The change applies to all domestic corporations and foreign subsidiaries
            filing consolidated returns.
          reasoning: >
            Despite its forward-looking revenue language ("will reduce revenues by"),
            this passage describes an enacted fiscal measure: it names specific
            legislation (Omnibus Revenue Reconciliation Act), specifies the enacted
            rate change (46 percent to 34 percent), provides an effective date, and
            identifies affected taxpayers. The future-tense revenue figures are
            projections of an already-enacted change, not a forecast under a no-policy
            baseline. The presence of specific rate changes, named legislation, and
            an effective date confirms this is FISCAL_MEASURE, not NOT_FISCAL_MEASURE.
