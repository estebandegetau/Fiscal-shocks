    interpretation: >
      Model refused to classify the FISCAL_MEASURE label_definition, recognizing
      it as its own instructions echoed back and returning prose instead of JSON.
      The NOT_FISCAL_MEASURE definition was classified correctly. Test III failed
      on one borderline example (Budget Enforcement Act passage). Test IV showed
      one flip on a borderline text (text_id 4) when label order was reversed.
    decision: >
      Tighten prompt to force classification output on any input. If unsuccessful,
      try rewording the FISCAL_MEASURE label_definition.
