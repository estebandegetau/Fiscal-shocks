## The Problem

- Credible fiscal policy analysis requires **exogenous fiscal shocks**: tax or spending changes unrelated to current economic conditions

- @romer2010 built the gold standard for the US using a "narrative approach" that classifies the motivation behind every fiscal action from historical documents

- **This has never been done for emerging markets**, where fiscal policy decisions have enormous consequences for development

- Manual replication is prohibitively expensive: the US effort took years of full-time research

## Our Approach

- Use Large Language Models to **assist experts** in identifying fiscal shocks from government documents, guided by validated codebooks

- The methodology combines @romer2010 fiscal shock identification with @halterman2025 LLM evaluation standards

- Codebooks are designed to **transfer across countries** without retraining: validate once on US ground-truth data, then deploy to new countries with expert review

- This is not full automation. LLMs screen and classify documents; domain experts validate results

## Scope and Deliverables

- **Phase 0 (Feb--Mar 2026):** Develop and validate codebooks against 44 labeled US fiscal acts

- **Phase 1 (Mar 2026):** Deploy to the full US document corpus (~97,000 pages); compare against known results as a benchmark

- **Phase 2 (Apr 2026):** Malaysia pilot with expert validation to demonstrate cross-country transfer

- **Phase 3 (May--Jun 2026):** Extend to Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, and Vietnam

- **End product:** A comparable, cross-country dataset of exogenous fiscal shocks for Southeast Asian EMDEs

## Resources

- **API costs (development):** ~$200--250 to validate codebooks on US data. This phase answers the feasibility question before further investment.

- **API costs (production):** ~$250--400 for US benchmark and Malaysia deployment. Each additional country adds ~$100--150.

- **Expert review (Malaysia):** 25--40 hours from a fiscal policy specialist to validate LLM-identified shocks, since no ground-truth labels exist.

- **Total estimated cost:** $475--700 in API fees, plus expert time. This compares to 6--12 months of RA work per country under the traditional approach.

## Questions This Data Can Answer

- What are the **fiscal multipliers** in Southeast Asian EMDEs, and how do they compare to advanced economies?

- Are **tax-based** or **spending-based** consolidations less harmful to growth in emerging markets?

- How do exogenous fiscal shocks **transmit to inflation, employment, and the exchange rate** in commodity-dependent economies?

- Do fiscal shocks have **asymmetric effects** depending on the business cycle phase?

- What is the **optimal fiscal response** to external shocks (commodity price swings, trade disruptions, global financial tightening)?

- How do fiscal policy shocks affect **poverty and inequality** in developing countries?
