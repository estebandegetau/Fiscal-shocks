Revenue Act of 1945,1945-11-08,1946-01,-5.9,Spending-driven,Endogenous,1945-04,-5.89,Spending-driven,Endogenous,"The Revenue Act of 1945 reduced taxes substantially in J anuary 1946.  The motivation for the tax cut was concern that the decline in government spending following the end of World War II would lead to deflation and depression.  The tax cut was designed to spur both consumer spending and business investment, and so replace government demand with private demand.  The corporate tax reduction included in the bill was also seen as a useful supply -side policy aimed at spurring reconversion. This motivation appeared in presidential speeches even before the end of the war."

This bill extended some of these taxes, but allowed others to expire. This bill was under discussion at the same time as the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 and came shortly after the tax reductions of January 1954.

The motivation for the tax increase was clearly to prevent an increase in the budget deficit and the possible inflation that a higher deficit could cause.  T he president’s Annual Message to the Congress on the State of the Union for 1956 stated:  “the pressing nature of this problem [inadequate highways] must not lead us to solutions outside the bounds of sound fiscal management” (1/5/56, p. 9)."

The 1960 increase, on the other hand, occurred a full year after the assoc iated increase in spending.  Thus, the dynamics of the economy after this increase are likely to have reflected largely the effects of the tax change alone, and not the earlier spending change.  Following our usual rule for delayed tax changes, we therefor e classify the 1960 increase as an exogenous, deficit - driven action."
