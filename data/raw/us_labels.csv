Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981,22,"Now, there won’t be a sudden boom or upsurge.   But slowly and surely, we’ll h ave a sound and lasting recovery based on solid values and increased   This implies a change in tax liabilities of –$48.8 billion in  1982Q1; –$57.3 billion in 1983Q1; and –$36.1 billion in 1984Q1.  If one ignores the retroactive  component of the 1981 cut, there is a tax cut of $8.9 billion in 1981Q3, no tax increase in 1981Q4, and  then the same additional tax cuts in later years.    The central component of the tax cut was a permanent, across -the-board reduction in marginal tax  rates in three steps.  New depreciation guidelines and a reduction in corporate tax rates reduced business  taxes as well.  In addition to the tax cut, Congress passed some spending cuts at the same time as part of  the president’s overall economic program.  However, the tax changes were much larger than the spending  changes.  In remarks made at the signing of ERTA in 1981, President Reagan said that spending would be  cut $130 billion over the next three years, while taxes would be reduced $750 billion over the next five  years (Remarks, 8/13/81, p. 1).      Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982    Signed:  9/3/82   Change in Liabilities:   1983Q1   +$26.4 billion  (Exogenous; Deficit -driven)   Present Value:    1982Q3   +$24.85 billion  (Exogenous; Deficit -driven)      The motivation for this tax increase was deficit reduction and increased fairness.  The fiscal  action was clearly not taken because policymakers felt the economy was overheating.  Both the 1982 and  1983 Economic Reports  make it clear that real GNP growth was weak and predict ed to remain so for a  while longer (1982, p. 25, and 1983, pp. 20- 23).                                                           18 The 1983 Budget  shows liabilities declining further in calendar 1985 and 1986.  These declines were due to  projected income growth and to further accelerations in the accelerated cost  recovery system (ACRS) scheduled for  1985 and 1986. Because the accelerations in ACRS for 1985 and 1986 were repealed by the Tax Equity and Fiscal  Responsibility Act of 1982, we do not include the projected tax cuts in 1985 and 1986 in our estimates of th e effect  of Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.       71   productivity and an end to deficit spending",,,3

Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990,4,"a little more in deficit      Because the act was motivated by a desire to reduce the budget deficit, and not by a desire to keep  output growth at its n ormal level, we classify it as an exogenous, deficit -driven action.    The 1991 Economic Report  said the act would increase tax revenues $150 billion over fiscal years  1991 to 1995 (p. 65).  The 1992 Budget  estimated that the revenue effect would rise from $ 22.5 billion in  fiscal 1991 to $35.2 billion in fiscal 1992, and then remain roughly constant (Part Three, p. 7).  Similarly, CBO reported that the act was expected to increase revenue by $18 billion in fiscal 1991, $33 billion in  fiscal 1992, and similar amounts in later years (The 1990 Budget Agreement:  An Interim Assessment,  12/90, p. 6; see also Projecting Federal Tax Revenues and the Effect of Changes in Tax Law, 12/98, pp.  30-31).   Almost all the revenue provisions were effective January 1, 1991.  Th us the first full fiscal year  the changes were scheduled to be in effect was fiscal 1992.  We therefore use the estimated revenue effect  from the Budget  for that year as our revenue estimate.  That is, we estimate that there was a tax increase  of $35.2 bil lion in 1991Q1.  Note that this figure is quite consistent both with CBO’s estimates and with  the somewhat vague number in the Economic Report .   The tax increases took a variety of forms.  There were some rises in marginal rates for very high  earners and r eductions for moderately high earners.  There were excise tax increases on gasoline and  other fuels.  The act also increased payroll taxes by nearly tripling the amount of earnings subject to the  Medicare tax.  All the tax increases were permanent (the 199 1 Economic Report , p. 65, and the 1992  Budget , Part Three, pp. 4- 7, discuss the changes).  In a speech, President Bush said the act would reduce  entitlement and discretionary spending by $301 billion over the next five fiscal years (Remarks  Announcing a Fe deral Budget Agreement, 9/30/90, p. 1).  Therefore, a rough estimate of the annual  reduction in government spending is $60.2 billion beginning in 1991Q1.       Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993     Signed:  8/10/93   Change in Liabilities (excluding retroac tive changes):    1993Q3   +$22.8 billion  (Exogenous; Deficit -driven)    1993Q4   +$5.3 billion  (Exogenous; Deficit -driven)    1994Q1   +$13.4 billion  (Exogenous; Deficit -driven)   Change in Liabilities (including retroactive changes):    1993Q3   +$68.4 billion  (Exogenous; Deficit- driven)    1993Q4   –$40.3 billion  (Exogenous; Deficit -driven)    1994Q1   +$13.4 billion  (Exogenous; Deficit -driven)   Present Value:    1993Q3   +$41.64 billion  (Exogenous; Deficit -driven)                                                            23 The report also argued for some of the revenue measures (including the increase in gasoline taxes) on the grounds  that some of the additional revenues could be used fo r valuable spending projects.
